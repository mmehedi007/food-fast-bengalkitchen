            <p>A healthy diet is essential for good health and nutrition. It protects you against many chronic
                noncommunicable
                diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Eating a variety of foods and consuming less salt,
                sugars
                and saturated and industrially-produced trans-fats, are essential for healthy diet.</p>
